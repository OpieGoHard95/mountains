CMP237 Extended example from Ch. 6
The fancy cells homework is contained in the file named gods.js
It can be ran with the command, d8 gods.js
It can also be ran by uncommenting the module defining lines in gods.js allowing it to be ran with the command d8 checkDate.js

It works, as in it gives the correct number of responses however it does not give the name of the items I wanted

I am going to do problem number 2, quoting style
